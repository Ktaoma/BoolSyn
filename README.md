We recommend to create the environment before running the script.

``` 
conda create --name BoolSyn python==3.9.7 pandas=1.3.4 numpy=1.20.3 requests=2.26.0 matplotlib=3.4.3 tqdm=4.62.3 scipy=1.7.1 joblib=1.1.0 seaborn=0.11.2 xlrd=2.0.1 -y 
 ```

Then, activating the created environment by ```conda activate BoolSyn``` to run jupyer notebook.

To run `.ipynb` file, you can directly type in the terminal ```jupyter-notebook script.ipynb``` on the created environment to open the jupternote book
